#### Intermediate JavaScript - _Pig Latin, 8/21/2019_
Pair program: Misaki Koonce and Makijane Gilbert

## Description
Write a Pig Latin translator or should we say an "igPay atinLay anslatorTray"?


## Rules of Pig Latin
- For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.

- For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".

- If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!

- For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.


## Website should have
- a basic user interface that allows your application to accept user input, and display output.
- `String.prototype.slice()`, `String.prototype.includes()`, `String.prototype.indexOf()` methods.
